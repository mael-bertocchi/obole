# ⚙️ Obole • Backend

The **Fastify + TypeScript** server behind the Obole portal: it opens the single account with a passkey and keeps the data of every app (the budget and the watchlist), backed by PostgreSQL.

## Features

- **REST API** • versioned under `/v1`, split into focused modules: the portal's own (identity, health) and one folder per app under `modules/<app>/`, served under `/v1/<app>`. In the database too, every model and table starts with its app (`BudgetOperation` in `budget_operations`; `Identity…` for the portal's own), so apps never fight over a name.
- **Passkey-only identity** • the single account opens with a passkey (WebAuthn), nothing else: no password, no code, no user table, no registration. The first passkey is created with an enrollment token you set only for that; the iOS app signs in through the portal with a one-time code bound to a PKCE challenge. JWT access + refresh sessions.
- **Entry-by-entry writes** • clients read the whole budget document at once (`GET /v1/budget/state`) and write it one entry at a time: an operation, a category, the settings, a frozen month. No route can replace or wipe the whole budget. Each write bumps a revision, so a client can tell whether anything changed since it last read.
- **A trash for operations** • a deleted operation is kept with the moment it was deleted, out of the budget, and can be restored.
- **Watchlist** • films and series to watch, then watched with a rating in half stars and a comment (`/v1/watchlist/entries`). What a title is comes from TMDB, which the server asks itself so its token never leaves it (`/v1/watchlist/catalog`): search, details with where to watch it in France (JustWatch data), sagas and genres, kept in memory for a while. A title and its saga's name are stored in English and in French, so the list reads right in either language.
- **Assistant** • a conversation with Gemini about the budget and the watchlist (`POST /v1/assistant/messages`). The model reads through tools the server runs itself, and can only *suggest* changes: each suggestion comes back to the portal, which carries it out through the ordinary routes once the owner confirms it.
- **Hardened** • Helmet, CORS open to the portal's origin only, rate limiting, Zod request validation, and a non-root Docker image.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:** Node 24 and a PostgreSQL database.

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Configure your environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in `DATABASE_URL`, set the portal's origin in `IDENTITY_ORIGIN` (passkeys are bound to its host name) and your name in `IDENTITY_OWNER_NAME`, set a long random `JWT_SECRET` (≥ 32 chars), and list the portal's origin in `CORS_ORIGIN` too (comma-separated if there are several; leave it empty to allow no browser origin at all, since the iOS app doesn't need it). To create your first passkey, also set `IDENTITY_ENROLLMENT_TOKEN`, and for the watchlist's catalog, `WATCHLIST_TMDB_TOKEN` (both below). Locally, the portal runs at `http://localhost:5173`, which passkeys accept as a secure origin.

3. Apply the database migrations

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

4. Start the server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The API is live; verify it with `GET /v1/health`.

## Identity

There is one account, and the only way in is a **passkey**: kept in your password manager, unlocked with Face ID or Touch ID, impossible to phish because it only signs for the portal's own site.

```bash
IDENTITY_ORIGIN="https://obole.mael-bertocchi.fr"
IDENTITY_OWNER_NAME="Maël"
```

Every passkey is bound to the host of `IDENTITY_ORIGIN`, and the server only accepts answers signed there, with the device's own check passed (user verification). Each challenge it hands out is single-use and lapses after five minutes. A signed answer gets a short-lived access token plus a long-lived refresh token whose session is persisted, so logout and rotation are real.

**The first passkey.** Generate a long random token and set it, then redeploy:

```bash
IDENTITY_ENROLLMENT_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
```

While it is set, the portal's sign-in page offers **Set up a passkey**: paste the token, create the passkey, and you are signed in. Then **remove the variable** and redeploy: enrollment closes, and new passkeys are only added from the account settings, signed in. If you ever lose every passkey, set a new token the same way.

**The iOS app** can't use the portal's passkeys directly (that takes the Associated Domains capability, out of reach of a free developer team), so it signs in through the portal: it opens `/connect` in a browser sheet with a PKCE challenge, the page signs in with the passkey and gets a one-time code bound to that challenge (`POST /v1/identity/connect`), and the app trades it with its verifier (`POST /v1/identity/connect/token`). A code lives two minutes, works once, and is useless without the verifier.

The last passkey can't be removed, so the account can't be locked by mistake.

## Watchlist catalog

The watchlist reads films and series from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org), free for a personal, non-commercial project. Create an account there, ask for an API key in its settings (*API*), and copy the **API Read Access Token** (the long one) into:

```bash
WATCHLIST_TMDB_TOKEN="eyJ…"
```

Without it, the watchlist still lists its titles, but searching and opening one answer `503`. Where to watch a title comes from JustWatch through TMDB, for France only. As both ask, the portal credits TMDB at the bottom of the watchlist and JustWatch under the offers.

## Assistant

The assistant talks to the [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs). Create a key in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com), then set:

```bash
ASSISTANT_GEMINI_KEY="AIza…"
ASSISTANT_GEMINI_MODEL="gemini-3.8-flash"   # optional
```

Every message sends the whole conversation (`generateContent`), so nothing is kept on Gemini's side between turns. The model sees the categories and reads the rest through three tools (`search_operations`, `month_summary`, `search_watchlist`); its four other tools (`propose_create_operation`, `propose_update_operation`, `propose_delete_operation`, `propose_rate_title`) change nothing and only return a suggestion for the owner to confirm. Without a key, the route answers `503`.

Once the server is ready, it reads the model's card from Gemini (`GET /models/{model}`, which costs no quota) to check the key and the model, and writes the outcome to its logs. `GET /v1/assistant/status` answers from that check, and the conversations correct it as they go: `reason` is `assistant-not-configured`, `assistant-refused`, `assistant-unknown-model` or `assistant-unreachable`, the last one checked again after a minute. The model thinks at a low level to keep each turn short. When Gemini takes more than a minute over one turn, or the whole conversation more than 80 seconds (Cloudflare, in front of the server, gives up at 100), the route answers `504` with `assistant-timeout`, which leaves the assistant on.
